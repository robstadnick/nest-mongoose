## Development server

Run `npm run serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files in angular or on the server.

## Build

Run `npm build` to build the project for production. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Then run `npm start`, to run in --prod.
